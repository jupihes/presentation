Review of status in Digitalization 
----------------------------------

Here are general views one what can be done. I tray to partition issues into different non-overlapping areas. 

1. **Digitalize operations**

- Internal processes digitalization. 

- Digital strategy to cover all aspects of the business

- Achieve a superior efficiency and cost advantage to compete with leaner and more agile competitors. 

   1.1 *Are we digital now?*
	
   1.2 *What are missed?*
	
   1.3 *where and how we can improve?*
      
      1.3.1 ITS
      
      1.3.2 NWG
      
      1.3.3 MKT and Bussiness planning
		
   1.4 *What and where do we need improvment?*
   
   	1.4.1 Slide 

2. **Look for digital practices beyond the telco industry**

- Digitalization initiated in multiple other adjacent and unrelated industry ecosystems. 

- Look for inspiration from applications and use cases across other industries.
   
   - sample?

3. **Transform at an optimal scale**

- How to transform?

 Adopt an iterative, agile and impact-oriented transformation approach

- Starting with a handful of concepts, i.e. low hanging friuts 

- Opportunities for collaboration with start-ups and partners must be leveraged to bring innovation from the broader ecosystem and bridge capability gaps across the organization.

4. **Adopt a robust governance model**

4.1 *Challenges to derive*
    
    - Scarce capabilities and expertise
    
    - Need Executive sponsorship

5. **Existing Competiotors and challenges**

   5.1 *General Challenges for Telco's - Slide*

----------------------------------

A complete strategic overhaul, including new, non-core market entries and radical organizational restructuring for a 
quad-play European incumbent.

General Challenges for Telco's 
------------------------------ 

What are general Challenges for Mobile Operator? 

1. Threat of new entrants

  - No special risk for now as new Telcom Operator is unlikely = Main barriers are huge needed investments, Sactions for seting up new operation, lic,etc.
  - Rightel may impose risk if it could manage to perform rationally which is very unlikley. 
  
2. Threat of substitutes

  - There is threat for digital services as any company with acceptable service may take a lead and grasp subscribers.
  
3. Bargaining power of customers
 
 - It is different per service and product. For some with free foreigne provider, internal/local's are not attracttive due to so many reasons.  
4. Bargaining power of suppliers

  - International providers may impose special request due to limitations and status of Iran Market.
 
5. Competitive rivalry

   - MCI threat to invest and compete
   - Competitive strategy from Shatel o other players

Next slides, present general challange status for Telcos.

Here is a quick and dirty cheat sheet for some common stuff you want
to do in sphinx and ReST.  You can see the literal source for this
file at :ref:`cheatsheet-literal`.
   

.. _formatting-text:

Formatting text
===============

You use inline markup to make text *italics*, **bold**, or ``monotype``.

You can represent code blocks fairly easily::

   import numpy as np
   x = np.random.rand(12)

Or literally include code:

.. literalinclude:: pyplots/ellipses.py

.. _making-a-list:

Making a list
=============

It is easy to make lists in rest

Bullet points
-------------

This is a subsection making bullet points

* point A

* point B

* point C


Enumerated points
------------------

This is a subsection making numbered points

#. point A

#. point B

#. point C


.. _making-a-table:

Making a table
==============

This shows you how to make a table -- if you only want to make a list see :ref:`making-a-list`.

==================   ============
Name                 Age
==================   ============
John D Hunter        40 
Cast of Thousands    41
And Still More       42
==================   ============

.. _making-links:

Making links
============

It is easy to make a link to `yahoo <http://yahoo.com>`_ or to some
section inside this document (see :ref:`making-a-table`) or another
document.

You can also reference classes, modules, functions, etc that are
documented using the sphinx `autodoc
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_ facilites.  For example,
see the module :mod:`matplotlib.backend_bases` documentation, or the
class :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.LocationEvent`, or the method
:meth:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect`.


Review of status in Digitalization - details 
--------------------------------------------


1. **Digitalize operations**:
Do not ignore internal processes digitalization. Ensure that the digital
strategy covers all aspects of the business and operational digitalization to achieve a superior
efficiency and cost advantage to compete with leaner and more agile competitors. [#]_ 

2. **Look for digital practices beyond the telco industry**: 
Adoption of digital technologies is evident
not only within the telco industry, but also in multiple other adjacent and unrelated industry
ecosystems. Telcos must seek inspiration from applications and use cases across industries.
3. **Transform at an optimal scale**: 
Adopt an iterative, agile and impact-oriented transformation
approach, starting with a handful of concepts, taken through various stage gates to achieve
tangible business results. Focus on achieving the initial lighthouse successful projects to inspire
the organization towards a digital operational blueprint. Opportunities for collaboration with
start-ups1 and partners must be leveraged to bring innovation from the broader ecosystem and
bridge capability gaps across the organization.
4. **Adopt a robust governance model**: 
Address the challenge of scarce capabilities and expertise
for leveraging digitalization in operations. The chosen governance should include executive
sponsorship, dedicated capabilities, expertise, and accountability to process owners
to ensure an organization-wide and sustainable transformation.
