title:: MTN as Digital operator; could i help?

My thoughts on Digital GM position
----------------------------------


These are my notes for this position.

I summarize writing as one Presentation in RST

4 dimension 
-----------

1. **Digitalize operations**: 
Do not ignore internal processes digitalization. Ensure that the digital
strategy covers all aspects of the business and operational digitalization to achieve a superior
efficiency and cost advantage to compete with leaner and more agile competitors. [#]_ 

2. **Look for digital practices beyond the telco industry**: 
Adoption of digital technologies is evident
not only within the telco industry, but also in multiple other adjacent and unrelated industry
ecosystems. Telcos must seek inspiration from applications and use cases across industries.
3. **Transform at an optimal scale**: 
Adopt an iterative, agile and impact-oriented transformation
approach, starting with a handful of concepts, taken through various stage gates to achieve
tangible business results. Focus on achieving the initial lighthouse successful projects to inspire
the organization towards a digital operational blueprint. Opportunities for collaboration with
start-ups1 and partners must be leveraged to bring innovation from the broader ecosystem and
bridge capability gaps across the organization.
4. **Adopt a robust governance model**: 
Address the challenge of scarce capabilities and expertise
for leveraging digitalization in operations. The chosen governance should include executive
sponsorship, dedicated capabilities, expertise, and accountability to process owners
to ensure an organization-wide and sustainable transformation.


Overhaul 
--------

A complete strategic overhaul, including new, non-core market entries and radical organizational restructuring for a 
quad-play European incumbent.

Here is a quick and dirty cheat sheet for some common stuff you want
to do in sphinx and ReST.  You can see the literal source for this
file at :ref:`cheatsheet-literal`.
   

.. _formatting-text:

Formatting text
===============

You use inline markup to make text *italics*, **bold**, or ``monotype``.

You can represent code blocks fairly easily::

   import numpy as np
   x = np.random.rand(12)

Or literally include code:

.. literalinclude:: pyplots/ellipses.py

.. _making-a-list:

Making a list
=============

It is easy to make lists in rest

Bullet points
-------------

This is a subsection making bullet points

* point A

* point B

* point C


Enumerated points
------------------

This is a subsection making numbered points

#. point A

#. point B

#. point C


.. _making-a-table:

Making a table
==============

This shows you how to make a table -- if you only want to make a list see :ref:`making-a-list`.

==================   ============
Name                 Age
==================   ============
John D Hunter        40 
Cast of Thousands    41
And Still More       42
==================   ============

.. _making-links:

Making links
============

It is easy to make a link to `yahoo <http://yahoo.com>`_ or to some
section inside this document (see :ref:`making-a-table`) or another
document.

You can also reference classes, modules, functions, etc that are
documented using the sphinx `autodoc
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_ facilites.  For example,
see the module :mod:`matplotlib.backend_bases` documentation, or the
class :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.LocationEvent`, or the method
:meth:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect`.
